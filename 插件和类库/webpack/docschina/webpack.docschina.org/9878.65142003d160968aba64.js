Because of our <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack">Open Collective</a> model for funding and transparency, we are able to funnel support and funds through contributors, dependent projects, and the contributor and core teams.

Developers like you can help by contributing to rich and vibrant documentation, issuing pull requests to help us cover niche use cases, and to help sustain what you love about webpack.</p> <h3 id="how-can-i-help">How Can I Help? <a href="#how-can-i-help" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h3> <p>Anybody can help by doing any of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Ask your employer to use webpack in projects.</li> <li>Help us write and maintain the content on this site (see the <a href="contribute/writers-guide/index.htm"/*tpa=https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/writers-guide/*/>writer\'s guide</a>).</li> <li>Contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack">core repository</a>.</li> <li>Become a backer or sponsor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack#support">open collective</a>.</li> </ul> <h3 id="encouraging-employers">Encouraging Employers <a href="#encouraging-employers" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h3> <p>You can ask your employer to improve your workflow by leveraging webpack: an all-in-one tool for fonts, images and image optimization, and json. Explain to them how webpack will attempt to bundle your code and assets the best it can for the smallest file size, leading to speedier sites and applications.</p> <h3 id="your-contributions">Your Contributions <a href="#your-contributions" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h3> <p>Contributing to webpack is not contributing to an exclusive club. You as a developer are contributing to the overall health of downstream projects. Hundreds, if not thousands, of projects depend on webpack and contributing will make the ecosystem better for all the users.</p> <p>The remainder of this section of the site is dedicated to developers such as yourself who would like to become a part of our ever-growing community:</p> <ul> <li><a href="contribute/writing-a-loader.htm"/*tpa=https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/writing-a-loader*/>Writing a Loader</a></li> <li><a href="contribute/writing-a-plugin.htm"/*tpa=https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/writing-a-plugin*/>Writing a Plugin</a></li> <li><a href="contribute/writing-a-scaffold.htm"/*tpa=https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/writing-a-scaffold*/>Writing a Scaffold</a></li> <li><a href="contribute/plugin-patterns.htm"/*tpa=https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/plugin-patterns*/>Plugin Patterns</a></li> <li><a href="contribute/release-process.htm"/*tpa=https://webpack.docschina.org/contribute/release-process*/>Release Process</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="executives">Executives <a href="#executives" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h2> <p>CTO\'s, VPs, and owners can help too!</p> <p>webpack is an all-in-one tool for bundling your code. It can handle fonts, images, data and more with the help of community-driven plugins and loaders. Having all of your assets be handled by one tool is immensely helpful, as you or your team can spend less time making sure a machine with many moving parts is working correctly and more time building your product.</p> <h3 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship <a href="#sponsorship" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h3> <p>Aside from monetary assistance, companies can support webpack by:</p> <ul> <li>Providing developers that are not actively working on a project.</li> <li>Contributing computing power for improved CI and regression testing.</li> </ul> <p>You can also encourage your developers to contribute to the ecosystem by open-sourcing webpack loaders, plugins and other utilities. And, as mentioned above, we would greatly appreciate any help in increasing our CI/CD infrastructure.</p> <h3 id="anyone-else">Anyone Else <a href="#anyone-else" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h3> <p>To anyone else who is interested in helping our mission -- e.g. venture capitalists, government entities, digital agencies, etc. -- we would love for you to work with us, one of the top npm packages, to improve your product! Please don\'t hesitate to reach out with questions.</p> <h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests <a href="#pull-requests" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="header-link"></span></a></h2> <p>Documentation of webpack features and changes is now being updated as webpack evolves. An automated issue creation integration was established and proven to be effective in the recent years. When a feature gets merged, an issue with a documentation request is created in our repository and we expect to resolve it in a timely manner. This means that there are features, changes and breaking changes awaiting to be documented, reviewed and released. That said, if Pull Request\'s author is abandoning it for more than 30 days, we may mark such Pull Request as stale. We may take over the work that is needed to finish it. If Pull Request author grants write access to their fork to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/webpack/teams/documentation-team/members">webpack Documentation team</a> we will commit directly to your branch and finish the work. In other cases, we may have to start over by ourselves or by delegating it to willing community members. This may render your Pull Request redundant and it might get closed as a part of the cleanup process.</p> '}}]);
